The current version of **AAPS** (3.2) requires an Android smartphone with Google **Android 9.0 or above**. The next **AAPS** version (3.3) will require **Android 11.0 or above**. If you are considering buying a new phone, (as of July 2024), Android 13 is preferred.  
As of November 2024, several users have reported issues with Android 15 and Bluetooth connection. You may wish to delay the update to Android 15, especially if you are using Omnipod Dash or Dexcom G7. Check [Facebook or Discord](../GettingHelp/WhereCanIGetHelp.md) for latest updates on this subject.  
Users are strongly encouraged to keep their build of **AAPS** up to date for safety reasons. However, for users unable to use a device with Android 11.0 or newer, earlier versions of **AAPS** compatible for older Android versions, remain available, see: [Release notes](#maintenance-android-version-aaps-version).
