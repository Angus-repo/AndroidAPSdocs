# Making changes to your AAPS' configuration

After you have completed the **[Setup Wizard](../SettingUpAaps/SetupWizard.md)**, you don't need to run the entire Wizard again if you want to only change parts of your **AAPS**' configuration.

There are three routes to change AAPS’ configuration. As to which route you take, it is simply a matter of convenience or personal preference as each route leads to the same configuration settings.

如下所示：

1. 組態建置工具，
1. Three dot menu on the right and select "Preferences" or
1. Three dot menu on the right and select "Plugin preferences".

在這裡我們解釋哪個選項對每種情況最方便：

## 組態建置工具

![Open Config Builder](../images/ConfBuild_Open_AAPS30.png)

如果你想**啟用外掛**及其在頂層選單中的**可見性**，則需使用**組態建置工具**。 Once enabled, the **plugins** will always run, and you can decide if you want to be able to see them in the top menu or not. Disabled plugins can not be made visible.

You can use the cogwheel next to each activated plugin to access its settings.

有關組態建置工具的文檔可在[這裡](../SettingUpAaps/ConfigBuilder.md)獲得。

## 偏好設定

The **preferences** dialogue can be reached via the top right _three dots_ menu on any tab of **AAPS**. This allows to change the configuration of **all enabled plugins in a single place**.

This is a good route if you are not really sure where to look for a configuration option, but it can be a bit tedious if you know you want to change the configuration for just one specific plugin.

偏好設定的文檔可在[這裡](../SettingUpAaps/Preferences.md)獲得。

## 外掛偏好設定

![Open plugin preferences](../images/Pref2020_OpenPlugin2.png)

The **plugin preferences** dialogue can be reached via the top right _three dots_ menu on the home screen of **AAPS**. It allows to change the configuration of the **plugin currently on screen**.

For example, this is a good route if you know that you want to change the configuration for BYODA. Then, you would select the tab "BYODA" on the top menu of **AAPS**, and then once you are on the BYODA page, in the top right, select the _three dots_ menu and then the "plugin preferences" entry. 你將直接進入BYODA外掛的偏好設定對話框。

This is a "shortcut" to the general preferences dialogue, the documentation of the preferences is available [here](../SettingUpAaps/Preferences.md).
