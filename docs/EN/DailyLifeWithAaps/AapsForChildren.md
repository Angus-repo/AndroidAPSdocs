# AAPS for children

**AAPS** can be used successfully for children as well. Anyway, there are some specificities to consider.

## Things to consider

Setting the correct [**Profile**](../SettingUpAaps/YourAapsProfile.md) (basal rate, DIA, ISF...) may prove difficult for kids, especially when growth hormones are involved. Take your time to set those correctly and test them in real life with your kid next to you before starting remote monitoring and remote treatment. Weekends or school holidays might be a good time for that.<br/>
Even when you have found a **Profile** that works for several weeks/months, keep in mind that, as the child grows, **Profile** adjustments will be necessary.

Think about how you will keep the child’s phone in range of their pump and CGM. This can be challenging with children who are too young to be responsible for a phone. Ensuring you select an **AAPS** phone with a good bluetooth connection range and finding a comfortable way for the child to carry the pump and phone - if they are old/big enough to have the phone on them, are key points. Many solutions exist, like insulin pump belts that also have space for a phone, or a harness to carry like a backpack.

There are several protection settings available to make sure the child doesn't misuse **AAPS**. See [Preferences > General > Protection](#Preferences-protection) to add password or biometric protection to boluses, settings changes, or even **AAPS** itself.

## Remote monitoring and remote control

Remote monitoring is an essential functionality when using **AAPS** for children. See the dedicated section [Remote Monitoring](../RemoteFeatures/RemoteMonitoring.md) to know more about the possible options.

Remote monitoring and treatment can be really helpful in kindergarten and elementary school. But make sure the teachers and educators are aware of your kid's treatment plan.<br/>
Work out how adding in remote control is going to work with/enhance the existing plan. Many parents find it helpful to have a separate line of communication with childcare providers, for example a cheap small teacher “follow” phone.<br/>
